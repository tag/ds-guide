# Welcome

Welcome to “Introduction to Data & Systems”. This course is intended to be a
practical, hands-on approach to learning about technology systems in modern
business. One of the great things about technology—and one of the most
frustrating things about technology—is that it's constantly changing. Therefore,
delivering this content via a digital medium seems ideal. Updates and changes
are immediately visible, which helps deliver the most up-to-date and relevant
curriculum.
