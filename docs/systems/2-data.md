What is data?
Is it different from information?
What’s the difference between data and metadata?
What does data look like?

Metadata: “Metadata are "data [information] that provide information about other data". (Wikipedia, “Metadata”)

Shareable: Readily accessed by more than one person at a time 
Transportable: Easily moved to a decision maker
Secure: Protected from destruction and unauthorized use 
Accurate: Reliable, precise records
Timely: Current and up-to-date Relevant Appropriate to the decision

 CAP Theorem (also called Brewster’s Theorem)
 At best, a distributed system can provide only two of the three guarantees:
 	Consistency	All nodes see the same data at the 		same time)
 	Availability	Every request receives a response 		about whether it succeeded or failed
 	Partition tolerance	System continues to operate 		despite arbitrary partitioning due to		 network failures

 Problems with data management systems
 
 Lack of redundancy
 Lack of data control
 Poor interface
 Lack of access/lack of security
 Delays
 Lack of reality
 Diversity of systems/silos
 Lack of data integration
 Volume of data
 
 
 Data silos are revealed as an organization grows.

 Data should have a documented owner. Other documentation should include meaning, associated risk/security, strategic importance, etc.
